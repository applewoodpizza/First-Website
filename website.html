<p> "Above, is a picture of Rumble, a Super Bee, in his natural habitat, 
on the side of a Scat Pack Challenger. He is looking back at his rivals as
he leaves them in his dust. The powerful engine on his back ensures that
his rivals don't catch him and his evil smile adds a little insult to his 
rivals injuries. His antenna guide him towards the finish line, ahead
of the competition." </p>
